## Eat, Sip, and Chill. . .

This application offers a food and wine pairing experience. To complete an evening of relaxation there is an option of a "movie-room" in which the user can choose a movie from a genre of choice.

([Use the Eat, Sip, and Chill... application and see what it is all about:smiley:!](https://heidijvr.github.io/Project-1/)).

**How The App Works**
- On the first page of the app, there are two columns. The one represents the recipes and the other the wine-pair with the
  recipe of choice. 
- The idea is that the user enters available ingredients at hand in the provided table to find out what recipes can be made with
  items available; 
- Next: 'Click" on the "find my recipes" bar. The app will provide you with a number of titles with accomanying images of recipes which 
  contain the ingredients indicated by the user.  
- When you click on an image of one of the suggested recipes, 1.) the recipe of the image appears in the left-hand column and 2.) a wine 
  paired with the dish shows up in the right-hand column.
- In the breadcrumb above the columns, there is an option to move to the second page i.e. the *movie room*.
- In the movie room the user will have the option of choosing a genre via a drop-down menu.
- The app will display the title along with its respective movie-cover image of the genre of choice.
- When the user clicks on the movie-cover image, a description of the movie appears. When the image is clicked again, the description
  disappears.
