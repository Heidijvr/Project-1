## Eat, Sip, and Chill. . .

This application offers a food and wine pairing experience. To complete an evening of relaxation there is an option of a "movie-room" in which the user can choose a movie from a genre of choice.

([Use the Eat, Sip, and Chill... application and see what it is all about:smiley:!](https://heidijvr.github.io/Project-1/)).

**How The App Works**
- On the first page of the app, there are two columns. The one represents the recipes and the other the suggested wine paired with the
  recipes. 
- The idea is that the user enters available ingredients at hand in the provided table to find out what recipes can be made with a
  limited number of items available in the kitchen; 
- Next: 'Click" on the "find my recipes" bar. The app will provide you with a number of suggested recipes which contain the indicated 
  ingredients. 
- When you click on one of the suggested recipes, a wine paired with the dish will appear.
- In the breadcrumb above the columns, there is an option to move to the second page i.e. the *movie room*.
- In the movie room the user will have the option of choosing a genre.
- The app will sugggest several options and display the title along with its respective movie cover images of the choice of genre.
- When the user clicks on the movie cover image, a summary of the movie appears. When the image is clicked again, the summary disppears.
